Problem 1
Explanation:

The procedure FindDistinctSum takes two sets (set1 and set2) as input parameters.

It initializes sum to 0.

It then iterates through each element of set1, checking if it's present in set2. If not, it adds that element to sum.

It then repeats this process for set2 with respect to set1.

Finally, it prints out the calculated sum.

The calculated sum is the sum of the distinct value of the two sets of arrays
